    Dies ist eine Aufgabe bei welcher man einen kleinen Übersetzer schreiben, welcher RNA sequenzen in Proteine übersetzt.  

    Aufgabenbeschreibung:
    Your task is to translate RNA sequences into proteins.  

    RNA can be divided into triplets of nucleotides called codons, each of which corresponds to an amino acid. For example:  

    * RNA: "AUGUUUUCU"
    * Codons: "AUG", "UUU", "UCU"
    * Protein: Methionine, Phenylalanine, Serine  
    
    Your task is to implement a function that reads a sequence of RNA and translates it into its corresponding protein sequence. Each group of three nucleotides (codon) should map to an amino acid, and the process continues until a stop codon is encountered. If a stop codon is reached, the translation halts, and any remaining RNA codons are ignored.
